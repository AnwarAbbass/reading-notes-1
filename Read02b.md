##### In order to explain Git, we have to first explain various aspects of Version Control.

## Version Control

is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. 

### Local Version Control

A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.


### Centralized Version Control (CVCS)

This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. allowed programmers to have more knowledge of team membersâ€™ activities with certain files by eliminating the need to involve all local databases. But the server as a single point if it has a failure the collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions.


### Distributed Version Control (DVCS)

Addresses the major vulnerability of the a CVCS by allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily by placed on the server to replace any lost information.
