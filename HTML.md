# HTML

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It used to build the content.

## Extra Markup

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
  *For version HTML5*   `<!DOCTYPE html>`

* You can add comments to your code -that will not be visible in the user's browser- , you can add the text between these characters:
  `<!-- comment goes here -->`

* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
`<p id="pullquote"> the paragragh </p>`

`<p class="important">    </p>`

* The `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

* `<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.

*example:*

`<iframe`
`width="450"`
`height="350"`
`src="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=moma+new+york&amp;output=embed">`
`</iframe>`


* The `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.

## HTML5 Layout

- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.
